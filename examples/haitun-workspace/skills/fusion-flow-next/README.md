# FusionFlow Next

FusionFlow Next is a temporary name for an isolated compiler-architecture package.
This directory intentionally has no `SKILL.md`, so Haitun will not auto-load it.
Existing `fusion-flow` and `.flow.ts` paths remain unchanged.
This PR only establishes compiler architecture contracts.

## Modules

- `grammar/FusionFlow.g4`: syntax only.
- `src/types.ts`: diagnostics, phase results, and an opaque Workflow Core IR boundary.
- `src/parser.ts`: parse-tree-to-Core-IR boundary.
- `src/checker.ts`: static semantics and exact-lowering gate.
- `src/generator.ts`: checked workflow to deterministic TypeScript boundary.
- `src/planning.ts`: Haitun lists planned functions first and checks for missing mappings.

## Current scope and known gaps

The committed grammar is a bootstrap surface: workflow blocks, operator-call assertions using assertion equality (`==`), identifiers, booleans, and ordered lists. It does not yet model declarations, numeric terms or numeric equality (`=`), formulas or rules, or the context-limited `consumes_multi` set from the language review. These belong to the language-contract workstream and must not be approximated by the parser or generator.

`WorkflowCoreIR` is intentionally opaque in this PR. A separate follow-up PR
will align its schema with KEDispatcher Core IR, define the missing workflow and
list extensions, and preserve source locations as compiler metadata. This
package does not introduce an independent AST in the meantime.

| Item | Intended contract | Current gap | Required compiler behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `S01` | `input_workflow` and `output_workflow` declare external artifacts. | Current `flow.input` requires a default value, while `flow.output` writes a supplied runtime value; the declarations do not contain those values. | The checker reports an error with `designReference: "S01"` and sets `canGenerate` to false until an exact runtime mapping exists. |
| Action names | Haitun maps every required action before authoring a workflow. | The action catalog is intentionally incomplete. | The future planning check compares names with `AvailableMappings`, warns for missing or unavailable mappings, and sets `canAuthorWorkflow` to false. |

## Activation boundary

Do not add a `SKILL.md`, workspace tools, a prompt switch, or runner changes until the parser, checker, and generator have real implementations and runnable checks.

Integrate in this order: generated parser -> real functions and checks -> inactive or opt-in Haitun checker tool -> prompt opt-in -> replace legacy only after migration is complete. Existing `fusion-flow` remains the source of truth until the final migration.

## Suggested work split

1. **Core IR contract** is a separate follow-up PR: replace the opaque `WorkflowCoreIR` marker in `src/types.ts` with the KEDispatcher-aligned contract.
2. **Language contract** owns `grammar/FusionFlow.g4`: define supported syntax, including constructs that cannot yet be lowered exactly to the current runtime.
3. **Parser** owns `generated/` and `src/parser.ts`: generate the parser, report syntax errors, and lower its parse tree directly into Workflow Core IR.
4. **Static checker** owns `src/checker.ts`: check workflow legality and reject constructs that cannot be lowered without changing meaning.
5. **TypeScript generator** owns `src/generator.ts`: convert checked Workflow Core IR into deterministic TypeScript and refuse unsupported input.
6. **Planning warnings** owns `src/planning.ts`: check the functions listed by Haitun and warn when a syntax or action mapping is missing.
7. **Haitun integration** updates existing prompt and tool entry points only after parsing and checks work: add the syntax-check tool and require planning before workflow generation.
8. **Compatibility and migration** owns runnable checks and the activation gate: keep the existing `fusion-flow`, runner, and `.flow.ts` path unchanged until final migration.

Dependency order: 1 + 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5; 2 -> 6; 4 + 5 + 6 -> 7. Workstream 8 runs throughout and gates activation.
