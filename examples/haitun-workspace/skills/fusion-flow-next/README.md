# FusionFlow Next

FusionFlow Next is an inactive compiler-architecture package. Its Python
compiler modules are not connected to the existing `fusion-flow` runtime or
the workspace skill entry point, so existing `.flow.ts` behavior is unchanged.

## Modules

- `grammar/FusionFlow.g4`: the syntax grammar; ordinary preset/external-operator arity remains checker-owned.
- `fusion_flow_next/contracts.py`: diagnostics and parse/check/generate phase results.
- `fusion_flow_next/parser.py`: parser facade and Workflow Core IR output boundary.
- `fusion_flow_next/checker.py`: static semantics and exact-lowering gate.
- `fusion_flow_next/generator.py`: checked workflow to deterministic TypeScript boundary.
- `fusion_flow_next/planning.py`: planned-function syntax mapping boundary.

The TypeScript compiler files remain during the stacked Python replacement and
are removed only after their Python equivalents pass.

## Current scope and known gaps

The language contract now covers file-level identity declarations, assertions, `!`/`AND`/`OR` formulas and comparisons, arithmetic, Lists, and value-producing `if(condition, then, else)` expressions. Workflow blocks contain assertions only; concepts and operator signatures come from an external catalog. The 23 preset operators are split into four disjoint owner groups, and all four `*_multi` operators return ordinary List terms. `FusionFlow.g4` fixes `if` at three arguments while ordinary preset and externally registered operators keep flexible call arity for checker-owned validation.

For a compact, readable BNF and consistency with KEDispatcher, preset operators remain syntax sugar over the same flexible call rule instead of receiving separate arity-constrained grammar productions. After syntax parsing, the checker/catalog validates their arity and types. Because that information is intentionally not encoded structurally in the BNF, every preset operator in `FusionFlow.g4` documents its parameter types, return type, and explicit arity for human and agent readers; the grammar contract test enforces this documentation invariant.

The generated parser is still not committed or wired into `src/parser.ts`. The current Core IR result carries one `Workflow` and has no dedicated file-level declaration or `if` node, so parser integration must first define a lossless mapping for global declarations, multiple workflow blocks, and `if` expressions. Operator registration and arity, catalog type compatibility, workflow legality, and backend support remain static-checker responsibilities.

The Core IR contains catalog-owned `Concept` and `Operator` references, typed constants, recursive compound terms, ordered list terms, assertions, and `NOT`/`AND`/`OR` formulas. `Workflow` is the only workflow-level class and stores one syntax-level block name with its assertions. Constants are carried by the terms that use them rather than duplicated in a document-level collection. The workflow does not redeclare concepts or operators.

Variables, quantifiers, truth formulas, theories, rules, and query/SAT/optimization requests are intentionally absent because the reviewed workflow surface does not use them. Operator execution, concept registries and matching, validation, parsing, generation, and Haitun activation remain separate workstreams.

| Item | Intended contract | Current gap | Required compiler behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `S01` | `input_workflow` and `output_workflow` declare external artifacts. | Current `flow.input` requires a default value, while `flow.output` writes a supplied runtime value; the declarations do not contain those values. | The checker reports an error with `designReference: "S01"` and sets `canGenerate` to false until an exact runtime mapping exists. |

## Activation boundary

Do not add a `SKILL.md`, workspace tools, a prompt switch, or runner changes until the parser, checker, and generator have real implementations and runnable checks.

Integrate in this order: generated parser -> real functions and checks -> inactive or opt-in Haitun checker tool -> prompt opt-in -> replace legacy only after migration is complete. Existing `fusion-flow` remains the source of truth until the final migration.

## Suggested work split

1. **Core IR contract** is defined in `src/core-ir.ts`; keep it limited to the reviewed workflow subset.
2. **Language contract** owns `grammar/FusionFlow.g4`; ordinary operator registration, arity, and types stay checker/catalog-owned.
3. **Parser** owns `generated/` and `src/parser.ts`: reconcile the full file grammar with the current single-`Workflow` Core IR boundary, generate the parser, report syntax errors, and produce lossless Core IR for later stages.
4. **Static checker** owns `src/checker.ts`: check workflow legality and reject constructs that cannot be lowered without changing meaning.
5. **TypeScript generator** owns `src/generator.ts`: convert checked Workflow Core IR into deterministic TypeScript and refuse unsupported input.
6. **Planning warnings** owns `src/planning.ts`: check the functions listed by Haitun and warn when a required DSL syntax mapping is missing.
7. **Haitun integration** updates existing prompt and tool entry points only after parsing and checks work: add the syntax-check tool and require planning before workflow generation.
8. **Compatibility and migration** owns runnable checks and the activation gate: keep the existing `fusion-flow`, runner, and `.flow.ts` path unchanged until final migration.

Dependency order: 1 + 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5; 2 -> 6; 4 + 5 + 6 -> 7. Workstream 8 runs throughout and gates activation.
