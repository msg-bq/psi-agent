# FusionFlow Skill (Fuclaw)

This skill is the author + run protocol for **FusionFlow** on **`@agent-flow/core`** (alias: Fuclaw). The LLM authors declarative FusionFlow source; the workflow toolchain validates it and the existing runtime executes it with a full **execution graph** for replay. Unlike OpenProse, where the LLM *is* the VM, here the VM is a Node.js process; the LLM orchestrates the run and reads its artifacts.

> **What you're working in.** The normal delivery is a **self-contained bundle**: the user copied the `fusion-flow/` folder somewhere, ran `npm install` once, and works inside it. Call that directory `<workDir>`. Everything below — workflow source, the `.env`, and `runs/` artifacts — lives **relative to `<workDir>`**, NOT inside an unrelated checkout. This skill runs in any long-context LLM client (Claude Code / Cursor / Cherry Studio / Claude.ai); it does not depend on OpenClaw or any plugin install.

> **No slash commands.** This skill is triggered by **natural-language intent**, never by a `/flow xxx` command. The user just talks: "帮我写个并行调研的工作流" / "跑一下刚生成的那个" / "刚才那个跑完了吗". Do NOT teach, suggest, or expect any `/flow run` / `/flow show` / `/flow author` syntax — those slash commands do not exist and printing them to the user is a bug (a user in an environment without this skill installed will see "命令没找到"). Map what the user *means* to the actions below.

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when the user:

- Asks to run a FusionFlow workflow or an existing `.flow.ts` they already have ("跑一下这个 / 帮我跑 / 执行"). This skill does **not** ship runnable demo examples; "run" always means a concrete workflow the user has.
- Asks to see the result of a previous run ("跑完了吗 / 看看结果 / 上次那个怎么样了")
- Mentions "agent-flow", "Fuclaw", or "@agent-flow/core"
- **Describes any task that needs a multi-agent workflow or agent collaboration**, even without saying "flow" — e.g. "让几个 agent 分别审一遍再汇总", "并行跑 N 个子任务再合并", "一步接一步处理(先 A 再 B 再 C)", "多角度评审 / 打分选边", "把这件事拆成多个 agent 协作". If the task clearly benefits from orchestrating more than one agent / parallel branches / a multi-step pipeline, enter **Authoring Mode** (below) and offer to build a flow.

When in doubt about whether a task is "workflow-shaped": if it would take **two or more coordinated LLM steps** (fan-out, pipeline, loop, or judge-then-branch), it qualifies — activate and propose a flow. A single one-shot question does not.

### HARD RULE: when you recognize a multi-agent task, your job is to BUILD A FLOW — not to do it yourself

Once a task is workflow-shaped (multiple agents / parallel branches / multi-step pipeline / judge-then-branch), your **one default action** is to enter Authoring Mode and build a FusionFlow workflow. That is the entire point of this skill — the flow runtime spawns and coordinates the sub-agents; **you do not play those sub-agents yourself**.

Do **NOT** offer "我直接帮你做这一次" as an option, and especially do **NOT** make it the default. Building the flow IS how you help — there is no faster "just do it manually" path that's better; doing it by hand throws away the runtime (parallelism, the execution graph, replay, the reusable artifact) and contradicts "one intent = one flow".

❌ **Real failure to never repeat** (observed in testing): user said "让几个 AI 从安全/性能/可读性分别审一段代码再汇总". The agent replied with "方式 A：我直接帮你审这次代码 / 方式 B：给你做成可复用工作流" — offering to personally act as the three reviewers, with the manual path listed first as the default. **Wrong.** The correct response is to go straight into Authoring Mode and build the review flow: three reviewer steps consume the same input, then one synthesizer consumes all three review artifacts. No A/B menu, no "I'll just review it myself".

✅ **Correct shape**: "🐾 这是个多 agent 协作任务，我来帮你搭一个工作流：3 个审查 agent（安全/性能/可读性）并行审 → 一个汇总 agent 合并成带严重等级的报告。" Then run the author loop (understand → model → author → validate → one heads-up line → **run it**).

The only time you don't build a flow is when the user **explicitly** says they just want a one-off answer and not a tool ("别给我搭工具，就这一次，你直接说结论"). Even then, confirm — don't assume.

Do **not** activate this skill for `.prose` files — those belong to OpenProse.

## Architectural Difference vs OpenProse

| Aspect | OpenProse | OpenFlow (Fuclaw) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VM substrate | LLM session simulating prose.md | Node.js running the `@agent-flow/core` runtime |
| Program format | `.prose` markdown DSL | declarative FusionFlow source |
| Sub-agent spawn | OpenClaw `sessions_spawn` | `@agent-flow/core` shelling out to an external agent CLI (claude / openclaw / hermes / psi) |
| State directory | `.prose/runs/<id>/` | `<workDir>/runs/<id>/` |
| Replay artifact | `bindings/*.md` + `state.md` | `bindings/` + `trace/` + **`execution-graph.json`** |
| Control flow | Prose VM keywords | workflow assertions, catalog operators, and artifact dependencies |

The skill's job is to:

1. Turn the user's intent into valid FusionFlow source, or resolve the concrete workflow they pointed to.
2. Submit it to the configured workflow runner.
3. Surface the resulting `runs/<id>/` and explain the execution graph.

## Intent Routing

The user talks in natural language. Map what they **mean** to one of these actions. There is **no slash-command syntax** — never echo a `/flow xxx` form back at them.

| What the user says (examples) | Action |
| --- | --- |
| "我能用这个干嘛 / 你能帮我做什么" | Describe capabilities in plain language (see "Capabilities" at the bottom) + offer to build a flow |
| "跑一下这个 / 帮我跑 X / 执行这个 workflow" | Run the concrete FusionFlow source or legacy `.flow.ts` the user points at, then surface `runId` + key bindings. **This skill no longer ships runnable demo examples** — there is no keyword→example catalog to resolve against. |
| "接着上次那个跑 / 只重跑改动的部分" | (v0.6) Re-run reusing the old `runs/<runId>/`; cached bindings skip the LLM. See "Resume" section |
| "看看结果 / 刚才那个跑完了吗 / 上次跑得怎么样" | Read `<workDir>/runs/<runId>/execution-graph.json` (or the most recent run) and walk the user through it |
| "环境齐不齐 / 能不能跑 / 帮我检查下" | Verify Node, the configured runner, the engine CLI on PATH, and authoring readiness (`<workDir>` has `node_modules`); run `npm run doctor` if present |
| **"帮我写个工作流做 X / 帮我编排 / 我想让几个 agent ..."** | **Author a new FusionFlow workflow from natural language. See "Authoring Mode" below.** |
| Anything else workflow-shaped | Interpret intent against this table |

## Running a Program

For FusionFlow source, use the workspace's configured workflow runner. It validates and executes the workflow as one operation; do not expose internal runtime artifacts to the user. In the psi-agent workspace, use the `flow_run` protocol described under "A flow run is long".

The direct `tsx` command below remains valid only when the user explicitly gives you a legacy `.flow.ts`:

```bash
# Inside <workDir> (the folder the user copied + ran `npm install` in), with .env present if needed
cd <workDir>
npx tsx <path-to-flow-file>
```

`<workDir>` is **the directory the user is working in** — almost always the copied `fusion-flow/` bundle folder. How to resolve it:

1. **Default: it's the bundle folder.** If you see `runtime/agent-flow-core.bundle.mjs` + a sibling `examples/` (and a `package.json` with `"name": "fusion-flow"`), that folder IS `<workDir>`. Authored workflows go in `<workDir>/examples/`, artifacts land in `<workDir>/runs/`. No config, no plugin, nothing to look up.
2. **Source-repo case:** if instead you see `core/src/index.ts`, the user is inside a cloned Fuclaw repo — then `<workDir>` is the `core/` directory.
3. **psi-agent workspace case:** if the workspace system prompt assigns a path such as `flows/<task-slug>/`, use that workspace-managed path instead of `<workDir>/examples/`. The workspace instruction wins; do not relocate the source beside the runtime.
4. **If you genuinely can't tell which folder to work in** (e.g. several candidates), ask the user once in plain language: "你把 fusion-flow 文件夹拷到哪了？我在那个目录里帮你跑。" Then **remember it for the rest of this session** — don't re-ask.

Never guess a path without verification. Never hardcode `D:/...` or any machine-specific path. Don't go scanning the filesystem for "a flow project" — work in the folder the user is actually in (see Hard-stop #4 in Authoring Mode).

To pass `flow.input` overrides, append `--input.<name>=<value>` after the file path:

```bash
npx tsx examples/flow-author-20260606-001.flow.ts --input.question="MySQL 还是 Postgres？" --input.context="..."
```

After the run, the script prints two lines you must capture:

```
[run] <runId>
[run] dir: <abs-path-to-runs/runId>
```

Use that `runId` to walk the user through the run (see "Reading a Run").

### Resume (`--resume`) — v0.6

If a run blew up halfway, or the user wants to re-execute only the parts whose inputs changed, append `--resume=<runId>` to the `tsx` command:

```bash
npx tsx examples/flow-author-20260606-001.flow.ts --resume=20260529-030614-slnw7h
npx tsx examples/flow-author-20260606-001.flow.ts --resume=last        # latest run in <workDir>/runs/
```

How it behaves:

- The same `runDir` is reused — no new `runs/<id>/` directory is created.
- For each `flow.session` / `flow.call`, the runtime computes an `inputHash` over `(provider, model, system, userPrompt, temperature, maxTokens)` for sessions, or `(serviceName, args)` for calls.
- If `bindings/<name>.md` exists **and** the meta's `inputHash` matches, the LLM call is skipped — the cached content is returned, and the graph node is marked `cached: true`.
- If the user changed a prompt, model, or `--input.*`, the hash mismatches and that node re-runs. Downstream nodes that depend on it will also re-run (their inputs differ now).
- Old runs from before v0.6 don't have `inputHash` in their meta. `--resume` falls back to lenient mode: name-only match. After the first re-run, those bindings get hashes written and become strict.

When recommending a resume run to the user, surface what will be reused vs re-run by reading the existing `bindings/*.meta.json` files first — never promise "everything cached" without checking.

Caveats to mention if asked:

- `flow.service` body changes are invisible to the hash. If the user rewrites a service implementation, tell them to either rename the service or delete its `bindings/*.md` first.
- Tokens reported in `meta.json` only count *new* calls. Total cost across the original + resume is the sum of both runs' meta.

## Running an LLM Flow: Pre-flight

Before executing anything that calls the LLM (a FusionFlow workflow or a legacy `.flow.ts` using agent/session/evaluation steps):

1. Confirm the configured engine CLI is on PATH (`claude --version` for the default). v0.7 auth is the engine CLI's own config, not a key in `<workDir>/.env`.
2. Internally estimate cost/latency from the flow's node count (each LLM call is a CLI subprocess, ~3-10s each; a fan-out with N reviewer sessions ≈ N calls). Fold that into the single plain-language heads-up line ("预计几分钟") — don't dump the per-node math on the user.
3. Say the one heads-up line, then **run — do not ask "要不要跑" or wait for approval.** The user already asked for the task; building + running the flow is how you do it. (Only exception: they explicitly said "只生成别跑".)

A flow whose LLM calls are all replaced by `flow.service` mocks (no `flow.agent` / `flow.session`) hits no network and can skip the pre-flight.

### Running is the runtime's job, not yours

When the user asks to run a workflow, your ENTIRE job is: resolve `<workDir>`, submit the target to the configured runner, then report what the runtime printed. For a legacy `.flow.ts`, the runner command is `cd <workDir> && npx tsx <file>`. The runtime spawns subprocesses (`uv`, `python`, etc.) under its own designed environment — git-bash autodetect, clean-env baseline, Windows shell handling. **You do not pre-flight the subprocess environment.** Specifically, before running:

- Do NOT check whether `uv` / `python` / `claude` is "on PATH" in your shell. Your PATH is not the runtime's PATH. A missing binary in your shell does NOT mean the flow will fail.
- Do NOT `pip install` / `npm install` / modify PATH to "fix" a tool you think is missing.
- Do NOT inspect or second-guess the flow's `command:` field. If `flow.exec` says `command: "uv"`, run the flow as-is and let the runtime resolve it.
- Do NOT run ad-hoc interactive probes such as bare `node`, bare `python`, or bare `npx`. They can open a REPL/prompt and appear to hang.

Just run the flow. If it actually fails, then go to "When a run fails".

### A flow run is long — never let a timeout kill it

A workflow run is not a quick shell command. Every LLM step is an external CLI subprocess (10–20s cold start), and parallel or multi-step work routinely takes minutes. Two hard rules:

1. **If your client exposes a background/long-running run tool, use it — do NOT run the flow through a foreground shell tool that has a short default timeout.** In the psi-agent workspace this tool is `flow_run`: call `flow_run(action="start", flow_path=...)` to launch the flow in the background, then loop `flow_run(action="status", run_token=...)` — each call blocks until the next node finishes, the flow ends, or a keepalive window elapses — and report progress from what it returns; when it reports done, call `flow_run(action="result", run_token=...)`. This is the ONLY correct way to run a flow there.
2. **If no background run tool exists** (plain terminal client), use the configured FusionFlow runner with the longest timeout your run tool allows. For a legacy `.flow.ts`, run `cd <workDir> && npx tsx <file>`. The runtime writes node-level progress to `runs/<runId>/progress.jsonl` (one JSON line per node start/end, with the node label) while it runs — read that file to report progress, do not assume a silent run is stuck.

### When a run fails

A non-zero exit (or a `flow.exec` non-zero `exitCode`) is a **STOP-and-report point**. Do exactly these three steps, in order, then stop:

1. Report the exit code, the `runId`, and the error tail the runtime already printed.
2. Read AT MOST two files to explain it: `runs/<runId>/meta.json` and the failed node's `bindings/<name>.md`.
3. State your single best hypothesis, then **STOP and hand back to the user. End your turn.**

These actions are FORBIDDEN when a run fails. If you find yourself about to do any of them, STOP — you are drifting:

- ❌ Editing the workflow source or any internal runtime artifact, or creating a `-modified` / `-quick` / `.bak` copy. **Never write or alter files in `examples/` to work around a failure.**
- ❌ Running the wrapped command yourself (`uv run ...`, `python -m ...`, `python -c ...`) "to see what happens".
- ❌ Launching probe processes, trial flags, kill-and-retry loops, or any multi-minute autonomous debug session.
- ❌ `pip install` / `npm install` / editing PATH / env to "fix" the environment.

The user did NOT ask for an autonomous debug session — they asked you to run a file and report. After reporting the failure, **STOP and hand back**. Do NOT create or run a `*-offline` / mock version of the failing flow "to show the skeleton works" — a mock with baked-in output is a forgery, not a proof (see the global no-mock rule below). If you think a deeper check is worth it, propose it as a single command and let the user decide.

### Don't fake or guess progress

While a run is in flight, your only sources of truth are the runtime's stdout and the files it writes under `runs/<runId>/`. Do NOT infer progress by scanning the external tool's output directory and guessing — timestamps on pre-existing files (e.g. a prior run's artifacts) will mislead you into reporting "it's processing" when nothing new is happening. If you can't see fresh runtime output, say "no new output yet", not a fabricated status.

## Reading a Run

When the user wants to see a run's result ("跑完了吗 / 看看结果"), perform these reads in parallel (resolve the target `runId`, or pick the most recent `<workDir>/runs/*/` if they said "上次 / last"):

- `<workDir>/runs/<runId>/meta.json` — top-level status, durations, call counts
- `<workDir>/runs/<runId>/execution-graph.json` — the tree
- `<workDir>/runs/<runId>/bindings/` — list filenames; read `final.md` if present
- `<workDir>/runs/<runId>/trace/*.json` — only on demand (these are large)

Then summarize for the user. **Default (non-technical user): keep it short and friendly** — lead with the result, not the metrics:

1. **一句话结果** — 跑成功了没 + 大概多久，e.g. "🎉 跑完啦，用了约 40 秒。" Don't open with token counts or agent counts.
2. **产出** — point them at the final answer: read `bindings/final.md` (or the most relevant binding) and show *that*, not the graph.
3. **出问题才说细节** — only if a node failed: say which step and your one best hypothesis.

**Developer / on-demand:** if the user asks "用了多少 token / 给我看执行图 / 哪几步" then show the technical verdict line — `ok in 12.3s, 4 agents, 18.2k input tokens, 2.1k output tokens` (read from `meta.json` → `totalTokens`/`llmCalls`/`durationMs`) + graph shape (node `type` tree) + per-branch results. Never dump the full JSON; be a curator.

## File Locations

Paths below are relative to `<workDir>` (the bundle folder, or `core/` in a source repo). The two runtime modes differ only in where the runtime code lives:

| File | Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| runtime code | bundle: `runtime/agent-flow-core.bundle.mjs` (single file) · source repo: `core/src/` | Workflow execution runtime |
| `<workDir>/examples/` | standalone bundle or source-repo workflow source | Authored flow programs |
| `flows/<task-slug>/` | psi-agent workspace source location when assigned by the workspace system prompt | Authored flow programs in workspace mode |
| `<workDir>/runs/<runId>/` | created by each run | Per-run artifacts (graph, bindings, trace) |
| `<workDir>/.env` | user responsibility (optional) | FLOW_ENGINE selection + optional ANTHROPIC_* passthrough for claude engine + FLOW_PSI_* for psi-agent |

## Authoring Mode

This is the flagship: turn a natural-language intent into a runnable FusionFlow workflow. The user just describes what they want in plain words ("帮我写个工作流做 X") — there is no command to invoke and no implementation format to explain.

> **NO-MOCK RULE (global, applies to all of Authoring Mode).** When you build a flow for the user, author **exactly one** real FusionFlow workflow and NEVER fabricate a mock/offline/simplified twin to "test" or "demonstrate" it. A twin with hardcoded sample output, fake numbers, or a fake executor standing in for the real work is a **forgery** — it always "passes" regardless of what the real flow does, so it proves nothing and misleads the user. Validate the one real workflow, then actually run it. If the user *explicitly* later asks for an offline twin, that's a separate request you confirm first — never self-initiate one.
>
> (This rule is about flows **you author for the user**. Repository-owned offline examples are sanctioned test infrastructure; the ban is on *fabricating a new mock of the user's flow*.)

### When to enter Authoring Mode

- User describes a workflow they want built: "帮我写个工作流 ..." / "make a flow that ..." / "帮我编排 ..." / similar.
- User asks "帮我写一个 flow ..." / "make a flow that ..." / similar in any LLM client.
- User edits existing FusionFlow source and asks you to "rewrite" or "扩展".
- **User describes a workflow-shaped task without naming "flow"** — anything needing two or more coordinated agents / parallel branches / a multi-step pipeline / judge-then-branch (see "When to Activate"). In that case, don't wait for the word "flow": offer to build one, then run the author loop below.

### The 5-step author loop

1. **Understand intent** — restate the user's goal in 1 sentence. If genuinely ambiguous, ask **one** clarifying question (don't grill them). Note whether the user looks like a *developer* (asked to edit FusionFlow source or mentioned G4/operators) — that's the only case where you show technical detail later. Everyone else gets the minimal plain-language summary.
2. **Model the workflow** — match the intent to one of the reference patterns below. Identify inputs, outputs, steps, executors, artifacts, dependencies, concurrency, retries, timeouts, and any catalog-provided operation the task needs.
3. **Author one FusionFlow source** — use only declarations, assertions, terms, and operators allowed by `grammar/FusionFlow.g4` and the active catalog. Use the workspace-provided target path; never invent a second copy.
4. **Validate** — run the workspace's FusionFlow validation entry point. Fix reported syntax, arity, type, or capability errors yourself, up to **3 rounds**. After 3 failed rounds, stop and tell the user what remains.
5. **Run it directly** — the user asked you to do a task, not to receive an implementation artifact. Once validation passes, say ONE friendly heads-up line ("🚀 方案定了，正在帮你跑，预计几分钟…" — a notice, NOT a question), then immediately run the flow. **Do NOT ask "要不要跑 / 跑不跑" and do NOT wait for `跑`.** The only exception is when the user explicitly says "只生成别跑 / 先给我看看别执行".

Never mention the source file, its path, G4, operator names, validation stages, or internal runnable artifacts to a non-technical user. From their side you are just doing the task they asked for. If they ask "你在干嘛 / 怎么做的", answer in plain business language ("我让几个分析分头跑、再汇总").

### Talking to the user while you work (友好进度，面向小白)

Assume the user is **non-technical** and just wants to know "你在帮我干活，没卡住". Your messages to them are NOT the runtime logs — the runtime's `[session] / [parallel] / [run]` stdout is for *you* to read, not to paste at the user. Translate each phase into ONE short friendly Chinese status line, then go quiet until the next phase. Do not paste raw logs, file paths, primitive names, token counts, or the execution graph unless the user asks.

Use lines like these (one per phase, not all at once):

| 阶段 | 对用户说（示例，按场景改写） |
| --- | --- |
| 开始理解需求 / 选方案 | 🐾 正在帮你规划… |
| 方案定了、准备开跑 | 🚀 方案定了，正在帮你跑，预计几分钟… |
| 某个子任务在跑 | ⏳ 正在跑「<这一步在干嘛的大白话>」… |
| 多个子任务并行 | ⏳ <N> 个子任务同时进行中… |
| 子任务陆续回来 | ✅ 「<这一步>」完成 |
| 全部跑完 | 🎉 跑完啦，结果在下面 |

Note: there is **no "等批准" phase** — validation 通过后直接进入"正在帮你跑"。Don't insert a "要不要跑？" gate between planning and running.

> **HARD RULE — 先开口，再起跑（遮住执行层的首字延迟）。** 每次 LLM 调用都是一个外部 CLI 子进程，从 spawn 到吐第一个字通常要 **10–20 秒**（子进程启动 + 模型冷启动），这是架构现状、你改不了。但小白看到的不是 runtime 的 stdout，是**你**——所以**在你执行那条会卡十几秒的命令之前，必须先发出一句友好进度行**（上表 `🚀 方案定了，正在帮你跑，预计几分钟…`），让用户那一侧的"首字响应"是秒级的。**顺序是硬的：先把状态行发给用户，再去启动 runner。** 绝不允许"闷头等十几秒、跑完才一次性回话"——那会让用户以为卡死。N 个分支并行时，开跑前那句就说"⏳ N 个子任务同时进行中，预计几分钟…"，把"为什么要等"提前讲清。一句够了，别每隔几秒刷屏。

Rules: keep each line **one sentence**, no jargon (use the 业务语言 map above — say "一次分析" not "session", "同时处理" not "parallel"). Don't narrate every internal tool call; only surface the phase transitions a human cares about. When something is genuinely slow (a cold-starting sub-agent), a single "⏳ 子任务正在生成中，第一次启动会慢一点…" beats silence — but don't spam it every few seconds.

### Hard stops in Authoring Mode (real TUI failures, do not repeat)

These are not style preferences. Each one was observed corrupting a real author run. These bans apply **whether you're mid-author or already running**:

1. **Don't fake a result instead of running.** The user wants the real outcome. After validation passes you RUN the flow (see step 5) — you do not stop and hand back a file, and you never substitute a made-up answer for an actual run. The runtime spawns the sub-agents; your job is to kick it off and report what comes back.
2. **Write OR run any extra workflow source beyond the one file the task needs** — not an offline twin, not a "simpler version", not a "v2", not a "test harness". One intent = one file. An offline twin with baked-in output is a forgery, not a test. If the user later wants one, that is a separate explicit request.
3. **Report numbers you did not get from a real run** — never present mock data, sample data, or figures you pulled from an old `output/` dir / `validation_report.json` as if they are *this* flow's result. The only result you report is what the run you just executed actually returned. If a run fails, report the failure (see "When a run fails") — don't paper over it with invented numbers.
4. **Work anywhere other than the resolved `<workDir>`** — the workflow source belongs in the workspace-managed location under `<workDir>`, and `<workDir>` is the directory resolved in "Running a Program" (the folder the user is actually working in, NOT a copy you found by searching the filesystem). Do NOT scan `D:/tmp`, the workspace root, or any sibling `*-publish` / extra bundle copy for "a flow project" and start writing/`npm install`/running there. If you can't resolve `<workDir>`, ask the user — do not pick a random copy. (Observed: agent ignored the folder the user was in and built files inside an unrelated publish snapshot.)

The real run is how you deliver — there is no "spend-free preview" step to offer the user. Validation is the pre-run check; after it passes, run.

### Heads-up line (说一句就开跑，不是 gate)

Keep this **minimal**. A real investor ("悠悠") and an internal teammate ("张浩") both bailed on the authoring flow because the summary was wall-to-wall framework jargon (`parallel / pmap / reduce / evaluate / choice / 原语 / 异构复合工作流`). Their words: "这么专业应该不是给我这种用户用的吧" / "这表述太专业太多专有名词了，我都不知道咋聊了". This line is a **告知**, not a go/no-go gate — you say it and then immediately run. It exists so the user isn't surprised by a few minutes' wait / the cost, NOT to ask permission.

**Default heads-up (use this for everyone unless they're clearly a developer):** one plain-language sentence on what they'll get + a rough time estimate. No primitive names, no API names, no pattern names, no file path, no per-step breakdown, no token math, no "要不要跑".

```
🚀 我来帮你做：<一句话讲清楚要产出什么，e.g. "并行调研 5 个 AI 方向，汇总打分后给你一份带『重点关注 / 投资机会』的总报告">，预计几分钟，这就开始。
```

That's it — one line, then you run. Do **not** add `做什么 / 要多久 / 你会拿到` as separate fields, do not list steps, do not show 🔧/🎯/📝 lines, do not show the file path, do not ask for approval. If the user is clearly a **developer** (asked to edit FusionFlow source, mentioned G4/operators, or explicitly asks "用了哪些语法 / 给我看结构 / 文件在哪"), you may then show technical detail **on demand**:

```
🔧 3 个 reviewer step 共用输入，1 个 synthesize step 汇总 ｜ `max_concurrency = 3`
```

Only show that line when a developer explicitly asks for it. Never push it at a business user, and never volunteer the file path unprompted.

**Jargon → plain-language map (so the default sentence stays clean).** Never say the left; say the right:

| 框架黑话（别说） | 业务语言（要这么说） |
| --- | --- |
| 原语 / primitive | 步骤 |
| session | 一次调研 / 一次分析 |
| evaluate / choice | 打分 / 选出重点 |
| pmap / parallel | 同时做 / 并行处理 |
| reduce | 逐层汇总 |
| pipeline | 一步接一步 |
| 异构复合工作流 | 多方向 + 分层汇总 |
| token / LLM 调用 | （折成）几分钟 / 花多少钱 |


Token estimate rule of thumb: each ordinary LLM work step ≈ 1500 input + 800 output tokens; each structured judgement step ≈ 2000 input + 50 output. Sum, then convert to RMB at the provider's listed rate (火山 ARK Agent Plan 包月里这是 0 元，flag it as "≈ 0 (Agent Plan)").

### Reference Patterns (the 5 archetypes)

Match the user's intent to one of these five shapes, then express it with FusionFlow declarations, assertions, catalog operators, and artifact dependencies. `grammar/FusionFlow.g4` is authoritative. Do not copy TypeScript patterns into the source and do not invent an imperative keyword.

| Pattern | FusionFlow shape | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Heterogeneous fan-out + verdict** | N reviewer steps consume the same input; a final step consumes all review artifacts. Set `max_concurrency` for the workflow. | PR review, multi-perspective audit, content moderation. |
| **Multi-step pipeline + final gate** | Each step produces the artifact consumed by the next; put `max_attempts` on the final quality-gate step. | Writing process, ETL, refine-and-check work. |
| **Homogeneous per-item + merge** | Use `foreach_item` for the repeated step and a downstream synthesizer for the resulting artifacts. | N PRs, issues, docs, or log records into one report. |
| **LLM-decided bounded iteration** | Use an active-catalog stop/score operator with `if(...)` and an explicit bound such as `max_attempts`. | Hypothesis generation, alternatives, exploratory analysis. |
| **Composite workflow** | Combine artifact chains, fan-out/fan-in, per-item work, and catalog-provided reusable workflow relations. | When one simple pattern does not cover the task. |

If a required operation is not one of the preset operators below, use it only when the active catalog confirms its name and signature. Never invent an operator just to make the source look complete.

#### Full-featured in-context example

This is the canonical review shape from the activation example: three independent reviewers consume the same source, then one synthesizer consumes their outputs.

```fusionflow

}
```

### FusionFlow syntax rules

#### File structure and declarations

A source contains optional global identity declarations followed by one or more workflow blocks:

```fusionflow
const input_artifact: Artifact;
const output_artifact: Artifact;
const work_step: Step;
const work_name: StepName;
const work_instruction: Instruction;
const worker: Agent, Executor;

workflow workflow_name {
  input_workflow(workflow_name, input_artifact) == True;
  output_workflow(workflow_name, output_artifact) == True;
  step_name(work_step) == work_name;
  step_instruction(work_step) == work_instruction;
  step_executor(work_step) == worker;
  consumes(work_step, input_artifact) == True;
  produces(work_step, output_artifact) == True;
}
```

- All `const` declarations precede all workflows.
- Every declaration and assertion ends with `;`.
- Workflow and unquoted constant names start lowercase. Concept names start uppercase.
- A constant may have more than one catalog concept, as in `const worker: Agent, Executor;`.
- Quoted constants are restricted IDs, not free-form prompt strings: no whitespace or escape sequences.
- Prompts, step names, tools, models, engines, and other domain values are catalog identities.
- Concepts and operator signatures come from the active catalog; source files do not declare them.
- Line comments start with `--`; block comments use `/* ... */`.

#### Assertions, terms, formulas, lists, and `if`

- Workflow blocks contain assertions only: `term == term;`.
- Top-level assertion equality is `==`.
- Comparisons inside formulas use `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, or `>=`. Do not interchange `==` and `=`.
- Formulas combine comparisons with `!`, `AND`, and `OR`. Precedence is `!`, then `AND`, then `OR`; parentheses override it. `and`/`&` and `or`/`|` are accepted aliases.
- A bare term is not a formula. Conditions must bottom out at a comparison.
- Terms may be operator calls, constants, booleans, lists, parenthesized terms, arithmetic, or `if(...)`.
- Arithmetic precedence is unary `+`/`-`, right-associative `^`, `*`/`/`/`%`, then `+`/`-`.
- Lists are ordinary ordered terms: `[]` or `[item_a, item_b]`.
- `if(condition, then_term, else_term)` is a value expression with exactly three arguments. It selects a value; it is not a Step, loop, or imperative branch.
- Prefer `True` and `False` for booleans.

### Preset operator catalog

Use these exact preset names and signatures.

#### Workflow

| Operator | Signature | Arity |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `input_workflow` | `(Workflow, Artifact) -> Bool` | 2 |
| `input_workflow_multi` | `(Workflow) -> List` | 1 |
| `output_workflow` | `(Workflow, Artifact) -> Bool` | 2 |
| `output_workflow_multi` | `(Workflow) -> List` | 1 |
| `max_concurrency` | `(Workflow) -> Integer` | 1 |
| `workflow_timeout` | `(Workflow) -> Integer` | 1 |

#### Step

| Operator | Signature | Arity |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `step_name` | `(Step) -> StepName` | 1 |
| `step_instruction` | `(Step) -> Instruction` | 1 |
| `step_executor` | `(Step) -> Executor` | 1 |
| `step_timeout` | `(Step) -> Integer` | 1 |
| `max_attempts` | `(Step) -> Integer` | 1 |

#### Data, iteration, and resources

| Operator | Signature | Arity |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `consumes` | `(Step, Artifact) -> Bool` | 2 |
| `consumes_multi` | `(Step) -> List` | 1 |
| `produces` | `(Step, Artifact) -> Bool` | 2 |
| `produces_multi` | `(Step) -> List` | 1 |
| `foreach_item` | `(Step, List) -> Artifact` | 2 |
| `resource_requirement` | `(Step, Resource) -> Integer` | 2 |

#### Agent

| Operator | Signature | Arity |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `agent_config` | `(Agent, Model, Engine, ApiBase) -> Bool` | 4 |
| `allowed_tool` | `(Agent, Tool) -> Bool` | 2 |
| `max_output_tokens` | `(Agent) -> Integer` | 1 |
| `temperature` | `(Agent) -> ComplexNumber` | 1 |
| `reasoning_effort` | `(Agent) -> ReasoningEffort` | 1 |
| `max_turns` | `(Agent) -> Integer` | 1 |

All four `*_multi` operators return ordinary List terms. Ordinary preset and external catalog calls share the same call syntax, but the catalog still enforces names, arity, concepts, values, and workflow legality.

### Modeling rules

- Declare external inputs and outputs with `input_workflow*` and `output_workflow*`. Their Workflow argument is the enclosing workflow name.
- Model sequencing through artifacts: a step that produces an artifact precedes a step that consumes it.
- Model fan-out by making several steps consume the same artifact.
- Model fan-in with `consumes_multi(step) == [artifact_a, artifact_b];`.
- Model per-item work with `foreach_item(step, items) == item_result;`.
- Bind each step to its executor with `step_executor`.
- Configure concurrency, retries, timeouts, resources, and agent limits with the corresponding preset operators.
- Use `if` only to select a term. Content-based scoring or routing needs a catalog operator that produces the compared value.
- Variables, quantifiers, rules, implications, biconditionals, query/SAT/optimization requests, local concept declarations, local operator declarations, and imperative blocks are outside this language.
- Never emit TypeScript, imports, `flow.*` calls, `run(...)`, or invented `parallel`/`pipeline`/`for` blocks.

#### Worked example: homogeneous per-item work + one summary

Use this shape for N documents, PRs, issues, or log records:

```fusionflow
const items: List;
const analyzed_items: List;
const item_result: Artifact;
const final_summary: Artifact;

const analyze_item: Step;
const merge_summary: Step;
const analyze_name: StepName;
const merge_name: StepName;
const analyze_instruction: Instruction;
const merge_instruction: Instruction;
const analyst: Agent, Executor;
const editor: Agent, Executor;

workflow summarize_items {
  input_workflow_multi(summarize_items) == items;
  output_workflow(summarize_items, final_summary) == True;

  step_name(analyze_item) == analyze_name;
  step_instruction(analyze_item) == analyze_instruction;
  step_executor(analyze_item) == analyst;
  foreach_item(analyze_item, items) == item_result;
  produces_multi(analyze_item) == analyzed_items;

  step_name(merge_summary) == merge_name;
  step_instruction(merge_summary) == merge_instruction;
  step_executor(merge_summary) == editor;
  consumes_multi(merge_summary) == analyzed_items;
  produces(merge_summary, final_summary) == True;
}
```

The repeated step is declared once. The synthesizer receives the complete List and produces one final artifact.

#### Decision: LLM work, structured judgement, local logic, or external execution

| Need | FusionFlow representation |
| --- | --- |
| LLM research, writing, or review | A Step with `step_instruction` and an Agent/Executor bound by `step_executor` |
| Structured score or decision | A judgement Step plus a catalog operator that exposes the compared value; use `if` only to select the result |
| Local deterministic logic | A Step bound to the catalog's deterministic Executor |
| External command or tool | A Step bound to the catalog's external Executor, with `allowed_tool` and `resource_requirement` as needed |

Do not place command strings, code, prompts, or secrets in the DSL. They belong to catalog/config identities.

### Anti-patterns to refuse

1. **Hand-writing TypeScript or `flow.*` calls.** The authored program is FusionFlow source.
2. **Inventing a keyword or operator.** Flexible call syntax does not make unknown names valid.
3. **Using `==` inside a condition or `=` for a workflow assertion.** These have different grammar roles.
4. **Treating quoted constants as prompt strings.** They are restricted IDs; use catalog-backed `Instruction` identities.
5. **Unbounded retry or iteration.** Use `max_attempts` or an explicit catalog limit.
6. **Agentic/external execution over a large item list without a cost check.** Each item may start a subprocess; keep expensive executors for work that needs them.
7. **Inlining a large document into an instruction identity or runtime argument.** Store the document under `<workDir>` and pass a path to a read-enabled executor.
8. **Relaying an external tool's secret through workflow source.** Let the tool read its own configuration; never encode credentials in constants.
9. **Sharing mutable state between parallel branches.** Use artifacts and explicit producer/consumer relations.

### Code template

Every authored workflow follows this shape:

```fusionflow
-- SCENARIO: <one-line user-facing description>
-- AUTHORED: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss> from intent: "<original user intent>"

const input_artifact: Artifact;
const output_artifact: Artifact;
const work_step: Step;
const work_name: StepName;
const work_instruction: Instruction;
const worker: Agent, Executor;

workflow workflow_name {
  input_workflow(workflow_name, input_artifact) == True;
  output_workflow(workflow_name, output_artifact) == True;

  step_name(work_step) == work_name;
  step_instruction(work_step) == work_instruction;
  step_executor(work_step) == worker;
  consumes(work_step, input_artifact) == True;
  produces(work_step, output_artifact) == True;
}
```

Extend this skeleton only with syntax and catalog operators required by the user's task.

### Validation self-repair

Run the workspace's FusionFlow validation entry point after authoring. Fix diagnostics in source order:

- declaration/order/name errors → repair the declaration or identifier;
- assertion/formula errors → check `==` versus comparison operators;
- arity errors → use the exact preset signature;
- concept/type errors → correct the declared concept or operator argument;
- unknown capability/operator → use a confirmed catalog operator or report the unmet requirement; never approximate it.

Re-run validation after each repair. Stop after 3 failed rounds and report the remaining diagnostic instead of looping indefinitely.



### Running it (automatic, right after validation)

1. Submit the validated FusionFlow source to the configured workflow runner (no approval step — this follows directly from step 5 of the author loop). In psi-agent, use `flow_run(action="start", flow_path=...)`, then `status`, then `result`.
2. Capture `[run] <runId>` and `[run] dir: ...` from stdout (these are for *you*, not for the user).
3. After completion (or on error), fall back to the "Reading a Run" protocol — summarize the run for the user in plain business language. Lead with the result, not the file or the metrics.
4. Only if the user asks how to re-run it later, tell them the workspace-specific invocation. Do not volunteer the source path or internal execution details.

### What Authoring Mode is NOT

- It is **not** a guarantee the workflow gets good *content*. We control structure, validation, and execution; the task instructions still depend on the user's domain.
- It is **not** auto-iterating on content. The user reads the result and asks for changes, but there is no "要不要跑" gate between validation and the first run.
- It is **not** a reason to show implementation details to a business user. Technical users can ask for the FusionFlow source and structure on demand.

## Doctor Checks

When the user asks to check their environment ("环境齐不齐 / 能不能跑"): in the bundle, the quickest path is `cd <workDir> && npm run doctor` (the bundle ships a `doctor.mjs`). Prefer that over hand-written shell checks.

All manual checks must be non-interactive and bounded. Never run a command that can wait for user input, especially bare `node`, bare `python`, bare `npx`, or package-install fallbacks such as `npx tsc` after dependencies are missing.

If `npm run doctor` is not present, check manually:

```bash
command -v node && node --version        # need >= 20; never run bare `node`
command -v npx && npx -y tsx --version   # any; never run bare `npx`
test -f <workDir>/.env                   # optional in v0.7 (FLOW_ENGINE config); the engine CLI's own auth is what matters
test -d <workDir>/node_modules           # must exist; if missing, report "run npm install in <workDir>" and stop
claude --version                         # the configured FLOW_ENGINE CLI must be on PATH (default: claude)
```

Report each as ✓ / ✗. Never echo any API key value. In v0.7 `<workDir>/.env` no longer holds an LLM-direct key — auth is the engine CLI's own config (the claude engine will passthrough `ANTHROPIC_*` from the shell environment if present, else use claude's own login).

### Authoring readiness

Authoring no longer depends on any external reference workflow — the full-featured example is **inlined in this SKILL.md** ("Reference Patterns" → "Full-featured in-context example"). Readiness requires the workspace's FusionFlow validation entry point and active catalog.

Validate the inlined canonical example through the same entry point used for authored workflows. This is an internal readiness check; do not describe its implementation stages to the user.

If validation errors, report:

```
✗ Authoring Mode unsafe (workflow validation failing)
  Reason: <first 3 diagnostics>
  Fix the validation or catalog errors before entering Authoring Mode.
```

Otherwise:

```
✓ Authoring Mode ready (inlined reference valid, catalog available)
```

### Engine readiness (v0.7)

In v0.7 every LLM call (`flow.session` / `flow.evaluate` / `flow.choice`) shells out to an external agent CLI (`FLOW_ENGINE`, default `claude`). Check the configured engine's CLI is on PATH. `flow.exec` needs no preflight (any command goes).

```bash
claude --version                                    # if FLOW_ENGINE=claude (default)
psi-agent run --help                                # if FLOW_ENGINE=psi
# Windows only: git-bash must exist for the claude CLI
test -f /c/Program\ Files/Git/bin/bash.exe || \
  test -f /d/Program\ Files/Git/bin/bash.exe       # one of the candidates
```

For the psi-agent engine, configure the workspace and profile. The runner invokes the configured
engine directly:

```bash
FLOW_ENGINE=psi
FLOW_PSI_WORKSPACE=/abs/path/to/psi-agent/examples/a-simple-bash-only-workspace
FLOW_PSI_PROFILE=fusion          # psi-agent reads ~/.psi-agent/config.toml
# Optional: point at a non-default psi-agent config file
FLOW_PSI_CONFIG=/abs/path/to/config.toml
# Optional: connect to an existing AI backend instead of psi-agent's configured provider
FLOW_PSI_AI_SOCKET=http://127.0.0.1:9000/v1
```

Keep provider URLs and API keys in psi-agent's own profile config, not in this Fuclaw/OpenProse `.env`. `FLOW_PSI_AI` / `FLOW_PSI_MODEL` / `FLOW_PSI_BASE_URL` / `FLOW_PSI_API_KEY` exist only as temporary overrides for local debugging.

If the engine CLI is missing:

```
✗ FLOW_ENGINE=claude not ready
  Install Claude Code from https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code, or set FLOW_ENGINE to an installed CLI (openclaw / hermes / psi).
```

If on Windows and no git-bash found in any candidate path, the runtime will best-effort probe at call time and surface a clear error. Doctor reports:

```
⚠️ claude engine may fail on Windows: no git-bash found in default paths.
  Set CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH to your bash.exe location, or install Git for Windows.
```

## Capabilities

When the user asks what this skill can do ("你能帮我做什么 / 我能用这个干嘛"), describe these in plain language — never as slash commands. The user just talks naturally and you map intent (see "Intent Routing"):

```
🐾 FusionFlow — Fuclaw / @agent-flow/core
用自然语言驱动多 agent 工作流，带完整执行图回放。直接跟我说就行，不用记任何命令：

  • "帮我写个工作流做 X / 帮我编排 ..."           → 用大白话描述需求，我帮你搭好并运行
  • "跑一下刚才那个 / 帮我跑这个 workflow"        → 执行你手上的 workflow，跑完报告 runId
  • "接着上次那个跑 / 只重跑改动的部分"           → (v0.6) 复用上次结果，缓存的步骤跳过不重算
  • "刚才那个跑完了吗 / 看看上次结果"             → 带你看懂某次跑的执行图和产出
  • "环境齐不齐 / 能不能跑"                        → 检查 runner + agent engine + authoring 就绪度

## Security + Approvals

Workflows run with the privileges of the process executing them. When a user points to an existing local workflow for the first time, show them the source before execution and review its requested tools, external commands, file access, and secret/config references. This does not add an approval gate to a workflow authored for the user's current request. For remote URLs, refuse: running workflow source directly from a URL is intentionally unsupported.
