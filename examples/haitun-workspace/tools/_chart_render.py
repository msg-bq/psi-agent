"""Private helper for the Feishu chart tools — render data charts to PNG.

Feishu's docx open API can't *draw* a native chart: block_type 21 (diagram) and 44
(board) are empty canvases the API can't populate, and the Sheets API exposes no
chart-creation endpoint. The one thing that lands a real, correct-looking chart in
a Feishu doc is an **image block** (block_type 27) whose media we upload. So this
module owns the "make the picture" half: matplotlib renders a PNG to disk and
``_feishu_impl`` uploads it into the document.

Design goals, in order:

1. **Legible in a doc.** Charts are read inline at ~700px wide on a white page, so
   everything is sized for that: 1600x900 @ 200 DPI (crisp on retina), 13-15pt
   labels, no cramped tick text, generous margins.
2. **Consistent house style.** One palette, one font stack, one grid treatment
   across every chart type, so five charts in one report look like a set instead of
   five different tools' output.
3. **Readable Chinese.** matplotlib's default font has no CJK glyphs and silently
   renders 中文 as tofu boxes (□□□). We resolve a real CJK family per platform and
   also fix the minus-sign glyph those fonts break.
4. **Annotated by default.** Percentages on pies, value labels on bars, unit-aware
   axis text. A chart the reader can quote numbers off of beats one they have to
   eyeball against gridlines.

All disk IO goes through ``anyio`` (never ``pathlib``/``asyncio``); matplotlib is
CPU-bound and thread-unsafe at module level, so rendering runs inside
``anyio.to_thread.run_sync`` under a lock rather than on the event loop.

    ``tasks`` is [(name, start, duration, group)]; time is numeric (day/week index) so
    this stays free of date parsing and timezone questions — the tool layer converts
    real dates to day offsets and passes ``tick_labels`` for the axis. Tasks sharing a
    ``group`` share a colour, which is what makes an owner- or phase-coloured plan
    readable. ``today`` draws a "now" line so slippage is visible.
