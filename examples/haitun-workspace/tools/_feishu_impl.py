"""Private helper for the Feishu tools — authenticated client + request execution.

Wraps the ``lark_channel`` SDK (already a project dependency): builds one
authenticated ``Client`` from ``PSI_FEISHU_APP_ID`` / ``PSI_FEISHU_APP_SECRET``,
caches it module-level, and runs ``BaseRequest`` objects through the SDK's native
async ``arequest``. Drive-comment requests reuse the SDK's ready-made builders;
docx/doc/sheet raw-content and create-reply requests are hand-built the same way
the SDK's own ``api/drive/comment.py`` does it.

# ── Bitable creation — new base, new data table, new field ────────────────────
#
# The tools above all need an app_token that already exists, i.e. a base somebody
# built by hand. These three create it: base (POST /bitable/v1/apps) → data table
# (POST .../tables, optionally with its initial columns) → extra field
# (POST .../fields). Writes prefer the user's identity so the base is owned by the
# person who asked for it, falling back to the bot's tenant token.
#
# Field `type` is the same integer vocabulary list_bitable_fields decodes:
# 1 文本, 2 数字, 3 单选, 4 多选, 5 日期, 7 复选框, 11 人员, 13 电话, 15 超链接,
# 17 附件, 18 单向关联, 20 公式, 21 双向关联, 22 地理位置, 23 群组, 1001 创建时间,
# 1002 最后更新时间, 1003 创建人, 1004 修改人, 1005 自动编号. Type 19 (查找引用)
# cannot be created. The first field of a table is its index (primary) column and
# only accepts 1, 2, 5, 13, 15, 20, 22 — Feishu answers 1254012 otherwise.

# ── Data charts as docx image blocks (block_type 27) ───────────────────────────
# The one way to land a real data chart (pie/line/bar/…) in a Feishu doc: docx has
# no chart block and the Sheets API can't create charts, but it does have an *image*
# block, and drive medias/upload_all can target that block directly. The dance is
# three calls and the order matters:
#
#   1. POST .../blocks/:block_id/children with an empty ``image`` block → returns the
#      new block's block_id. The block exists but renders as a placeholder.
#   2. POST drive/v1/medias/upload_all with parent_type="docx_image" and
#      parent_node=<that block_id> → uploads the PNG *into* the block.
#   3. PATCH .../blocks/:block_id with replace_image=<file_token> → binds the token so
#      the block renders the picture.
#
# Step 3 is required: without it the upload is attached but the block keeps showing
# a placeholder. An empty image block left behind by a failed step 2/3 is worse than
# no chart, so failures try to clean it up.
