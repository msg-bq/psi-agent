"""Assemble the request's ``tools`` array, and hold it still for the Session.

``tools`` is part of the upstream prefix-cache key. Measured against
deepseek-v4-flash on 2026-09-03: removing one tool from an 8-tool array dropped
the cache hit from 19456 to 13568 tokens even though the tool region was 0.7%
of the body. Every change to the array therefore costs a re-prefill of
everything cached behind it.

The array is not naturally stable. ``ToolRegistry.refresh()`` re-reads the tool
roots at the top of every turn, so a tool file appearing mid-Session — or an
edited description, or a registry that happens to enumerate in another order —
rewrites it. Production showed this directly: a build that exposed tools as they
were first used logged ``tools_exposed=53 of 210`` against a 49-entry list, i.e.
the array had already changed at least four times in one Session.

So the array is frozen: assembled once, then reused verbatim for the life of
the Session. Freezing is deliberately *not* trimming — the first array is sent
whole, all 210 tools of it. Reducing the tool count is a separate change with
its own capability-loss risk; this one only stops the array from moving, which
is free.
